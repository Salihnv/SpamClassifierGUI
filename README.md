# SpamClassifierGUI


Overview
SpamClassifierApp is a simple yet powerful application designed to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using a machine learning model. The application is built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm for email classification. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of training a machine learning model, saving it, and integrating it into a user-friendly GUI application.

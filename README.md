# SpamClassifierGUI




## Overview

SpamClassifierApp is a simple yet powerful application designed to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using a machine learning model. The application is built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm for email classification. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of training a machine learning model, saving it, and integrating it into a user-friendly GUI application.

## Features

- **Spam Classification:** Accurately classifies emails as spam or ham based on their content.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter for inputting email text and displaying results.
- **Model Training:** Includes code for training a spam classifier using the SpamAssassin Public Corpus dataset.
- **Model Persistence:** Trained model is saved and loaded from a file, making the application reusable without retraining.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- pickle
